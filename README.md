Helper functions for reference management software.

## Motivation

While I like Mendeley, they are a closed source software. 
Other ones don't offer an API for low level operations related to reference management.
Their software are tightly bound by the GUI, and the user is stuck by this fact.
We think offering a low level API could motivate people for developing proper software to help academic community.
